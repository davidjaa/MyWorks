# SaleSystem

    The SaleSystem uses HSQLDB to store warehouse items, but
    right now I uploaded files that doess't use database for easier testing.  


How to open SaleSystemGUI/CLI:

    Download the folder.

    SaleSystemGUI/CLI folder -> bin folder -> SaleSystemGUI/CLI.bat

    Credentials:
        usernames: cashier/warehouse/manager
        password: pass

    *Every user has access to different tabs.
