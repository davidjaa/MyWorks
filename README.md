# MyWorks

# SaleSystem

    The SaleSystem uses HSQLDB to store warehouse items, but
    right now I uploaded files that doess't use database for easier testing.  


How to open SaleSystemGUI/CLI:

    SaleSystemGUI/CLI folder -> bin folder -> SaleSystemGUI/CLI.bat

    Credentials:   
        usernames: cashier/warehouse/manager
        password: pass

    *Every user has access to different tabs.

# Website

The website itself is not so complex, but the main goal was to learn
how to use databases on websites.
